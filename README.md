## Main Features (not all are implemented yet)

- User Authentication: Users can register, log in, and log out securely. Passwords are hashed for security using the SHA-256 algorithm.

- Symbol Quiz: The application offers an interactive quiz to test users' knowledge of mathematical symbols. Users receive points based on their correct answers, and their progress is tracked.

- Admin Panel: Administrators can access a dedicated panel for user management. This includes the ability to ban and unban users, view user scores, and access statistical information.

- User Bans: Administrators can impose temporary bans on users, specifying the reason for the ban and its duration. Banned users are redirected to a personalized page.

- Complaint Submission: Users can submit complaints through the application. Administrators can review and address these complaints through a designated section.

- Statistics Page: Users can view their own scores and ranks in comparison to other users. The statistics page provides insights into the overall performance of users.

- Secure Database Storage: User data, including usernames, hashed passwords, scores, and ban statuses, is stored securely in an SQLite database.

- Flask Extensions: The application utilizes Flask extensions such as Flask-SQLAlchemy for efficient database management, Flask-Login for user session management, and Flask-WTF for form handling.

- Web-based Interface: The user interface is implemented using HTML templates, providing a clean and intuitive design.
